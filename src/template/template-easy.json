Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with `color`.\n\nReturn _the modified image after performing the flood fill_.",

It is not necessary to pass the image every time, because it's mutable, but we require the other parameters each time. We then check if the current position is out of bounds or if the current pixel color at the position is not the same as the starting color or if the current pixel color is equal to the new color. If any of these conditions are met, we return without modifying the image. Otherwise, we set the color of the current pixel to the new color and call `fill` function recursively for each adjacent 4-directionally connected pixel. The main function first sets the `startColor` as the color of the pixel image[sr][sc] and then executes the `fill` function with `sr`, `sc`, `newColor`, and `startColor`.

For each bit, it checks whether the bit is set (1) or not. If the bit is set and its index (0-indexed) is even, it increments the `even` count in `answer`. If the bit is set and its index is odd, it increments the `odd` count in `answer`. The algorithm continues until all bits of the number have been processed. Finally, it returns the `answer` array containing the counts of even and odd indices with the value of 1 in the binary representation of `n`.\n    ",

Check if there is any identical number `num1` and `num2` in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively (`num1 == num2`). If found, return that shared number. This is because the problem states that we need the smallest number that contains at least one digit from each array, and a shared number will always be smaller than the result obtained by concatenating the smallest digits from each array (due to the unique digits constraint in the problem statement).\n3. If no shared number is found, concatenate the smallest numbers of each array (`min1 * 10 + min2`). This gives the smallest possible number containing at least one digit from each array.\n    ",
