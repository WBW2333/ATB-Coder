The idea is to find the pivot index 'mid' such that there are 'mid' number of elements greater than or equal to 'mid'. Since the array is sorted, we can leverage binary search by comparing the middle element's value to the number of elements on its right side (which can be calculated as 'n - mid'). If the number of elements on the right side is equal to the value at mid, we found the h-index. Otherwise, if the number of elements on the right side is less than the value at mid, we move our search to the left half of the array. If the number of elements is greater than the value at mid, we move our search to the right half of the array. This process ensures logarithmic time complexity as we eliminate half of the array in each iteration.

We maintain a window, and traverse through the array from the left side to the right side. When we find a 0, we increment the count of zeros in the window. If the count of zeros is greater than 1, we remove elements from the left side of the window until we have only 1 zero in the window. This way, we make sure we calculate the maximum number of consecutive ones when a single zero is flipped.\n\nFor each window, we update the maximum consecutive ones by comparing the current window size (right - left + 1) with max_count.\n\nIn the follow-up case where the input numbers come in one by one as an infinite stream, we can still use the same sliding window technique efficiently. We don't need to store all numbers, as we only need to store the current window of numbers which has at most size N (in the worst case where all numbers are 1). The time complexity is O(N) for the entire stream of numbers.\n    ",

If `'c'` is a star, it can be replaced with any digit from '1' to '9', so we need to calculate how many ways we can decode each possibility. Similarly, we need to handle the case when `'c'` is not a star but `'prevC'` is.\n\nFinally, we update the number of ways to decode the string at each position, taking care of the modulo operation to avoid integer overflow issues.\n\nThe final answer will be the number of ways to decode the entire string, which is stored in `dp[n]`.\n    ",

Add the cost of traveling from this station to the next one to `total_cost`.\n3. Add the net gain/loss of gas (gas[i] - cost[i]) to `gas_tank`.\n4.

Loop through the string `s` in reverse order (from end to start) using index `i`. This allows us to find the longest palindrome substring starting at the current position.\n4. For each `i`, find the longest palindrome substring starting at that position using another loop with an index `j`. Here, we continuously check if the substring from position `i` to `j` is a palindrome using our `dp` array.\n5. If the current palindrome substring length (`j - i + 1`) is at least `k` and `dp[i][j]` is `true`, increment the count, and update i to j to avoid overlapping substrings.\n6.

        "thought_name": "Maximum Vacation Days",
        "thought_question": "LeetCode wants to give one of its best employees the option to travel among `n` cities to collect algorithm problems. But all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, you could take vacations in some particular cities and weeks. Your job is to schedule the traveling to maximize the number of vacation days you could take, but there are certain rules and restrictions you need to follow.\n\nRules and restrictions:\n\n1.  You can only travel among `n` cities, represented by indexes from `0` to `n - 1`. Initially, you are in the city indexed `0` on **Monday**.\n2.  The cities are connected by flights. The flights are represented as an `n x n` matrix (not necessarily symmetrical), called `flights` representing the airline status from the city `i` to the city `j`. If there is no flight from the city `i` to the city `j`, `flights[i][j] == 0`; Otherwise, `flights[i][j] == 1`. Also, `flights[i][i] == 0` for all `i`.\n3.  You totally have `k` weeks (each week has **seven days**) to travel. You can only take flights at most once per day and can only take flights on each week's Monday morning. Since flight time is so short, we do not consider the impact of flight time.\n4.  For each city, you can only have restricted vacation days in different weeks, given an `n x k` matrix called `days` representing this relationship. For the value of `days[i][j]`, it represents the maximum days you could take a vacation in the city `i` in the week `j`.\n5.  You could stay in a city beyond the number of vacation days, but you should work on the extra days, which will not be counted as vacation days.\n6.  If you fly from city `A` to city `B` and take the vacation on that day, the deduction towards vacation days will count towards the vacation days of city `B` in that week.\n7.  We do not consider the impact of flight hours on the calculation of vacation days.\n\nGiven the two matrices `flights` and `days`, return _the maximum vacation days you could take during_ `k` _weeks_.",

The goal is to make all the elements of the array **equal**. It is **guaranteed** that all the elements of the array can be made equal using some operations.\n\nGiven an integer `n`, the length of the array, return _the minimum number of operations_ needed to make all the elements of arr equal.",
        "thought_answer": "\n    ```python\ndef min_operations(n):\n    return n * n // 4\n```\n    \n    This problem can be solved mathematically without iterating through the array. Since the given array is of length `n` and always has the pattern `arr[i] = (2 * i) + 1`, the average value will always be the middle value when `n` is odd, and the average of two middle values when `n` is even.\n\nIn both cases, you can calculate the number of operations needed to make all elements equal by using the following formula: `n * n / 4`. The integer division (`//` in Python) and `Math.floor()` in JavaScript are used to get the integer result of the division.\n\nFor example, for `n = 3`, the array will be `[1, 3, 5]`. The average value is `3`, and you need 2 operations to turn `1` and `5` into `3`. The formula `n * n / 4` yields `3 * 3 / 4` = `2`. Similarly, for `n = 6`, the array will be `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]`, and you need 9 operations to make all elements equal. The formula gives `6 * 6 / 4` = `9`.\n    ",

It starts by checking the base cases when n is 0 or 1, and then recursively calls the helper function with n-2. This helps to build the strobogrammatic numbers by appending to the center of the existing numbers until the desired length is reached. Inside the loop, the code adds the possible pairs of strobogrammatic digits (\"1\" + s + \"1\", \"6\" + s + \"9\", \"8\" + s + \"8\", \"9\" + s + \"6\") and for even lengths only, it adds 0s as well (\"0\" + s + \"0\"). This is because when we are building the number from the center, we cannot have leading zeros. Finally, it returns the list of strobogrammatic numbers of length n.\n    ",

For each cell, we consider the right and down adjacent cells (if they exist) and calculate the minimum health required to move forward. We update the \"dp\" table with these values. The minimum of the health required to move right or down, plus the current cell dungeon value, is then stored in the current cell in the \"dp\" table. Finally, we return the absolute value of the top-left cell of \"dp\" table plus one (for the initial health point). This gives us the minimum initial health needed to get to the princess.\n    ",
