When iterating through the left subarray with `i`, we move `j` from the right subarray until we find the first index that doesn't satisfy the condition or we reach the end of the right subarray. The difference between the current position of `j` and the starting position is the count of valid reverse pairs. To get the overall count, we sum up the count value from both the left and right subarrays and also add the count found during merging the subarrays.\n\nFinally, we merge the sorted subarrays using built-in sort functions. The process is similar in all four languages: C++ uses `std::merge` and `std::copy`, Java uses `System.arraycopy`, Python uses list slicing with `sorted()`, and JavaScript uses `Array.prototype.sort()` and `Array.prototype.splice()`.\n\nThe time complexity of the algorithm is O(n log n), as it takes advantage of the merge sort structure.\n    ",

Your job is to schedule the traveling to maximize the number of vacation days you could take, but there are certain rules and restrictions you need to follow.\n\nRules and restrictions:\n\n1.  You can only travel among `n` cities, represented by indexes from `0` to `n - 1`. Initially, you are in the city indexed `0` on **Monday**.\n2.  The cities are connected by flights.

We use a 2D boolean array `dp`, where `dp[i][j]` will be `true` if the string from index `i` to `j` is a palindrome.\n\nThe main idea of the algorithm is to iterate through the string 's' and for each position, we find the longest palindrome substring starting at that position. If it is longer than or equal to length 'k' we count it and move to the next non-overlapping position. Otherwise, we continue to check the next position.\n\nHere is the procedure for each programming language:\n\n1. If `s.length < k`, there cannot be a palindrome substring of length at least k, and we return 0.\n2. Initialize a 2D boolean `dp` array with dimensions `n x n`.\n3. Loop through the string `s` in reverse order (from end to start) using index `i`. This allows us to find the longest palindrome substring starting at the current position.\n4. For each `i`, find the longest palindrome substring starting at that position using another loop with an index `j`. Here, we continuously check if the substring from position `i` to `j` is a palindrome using our `dp` array.\n5. If the current palindrome substring length (`j - i + 1`) is at least `k` and `dp[i][j]` is `true`, increment the count, and update i to j to avoid overlapping substrings.\n6. Return count.\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) and space complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of string s.\n    ",
